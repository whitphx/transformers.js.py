    This is a proxy object that not only proxies function calls and attr accesses to the Transformers.js APIs,
    but also imports the Transformers.js library by calling `import_transformers_js()` when calling the proxy object.
    Importing the Transformers.js library is deferred until the proxy object is called,
    so the developer can use the proxy object and access its attributes without awaiting the import
    until it is actually needed by calling the proxy object.
    This makes it possible to import the proxy object of some method or attribute
    such as `pipeline()` from the `transformers_js_py` package directly,
    in combination with the `__getattr__` method in the `transformers_js_py` package.
